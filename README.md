## Order Management
In order management, you can view, edit, and delete orders with customer ID, customer name, order ID, etc., details. It shows a list of orders, including details like order ID, customer name, order date, and status, using mock data. It allows viewing of order details, updating the order status, and deletion of orders.

## Calendar
In the calendar, you can view pending or delivered orders and navigate through all orders. It implements a calendar view that displays orders on their expected delivery dates. It provides the ability to click on a date to view all orders due for delivery that day.
